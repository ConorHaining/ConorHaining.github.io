About a month or so ago, a job advert passed by me for what at first glace looked like an absolute dream. It was a position that promised an engaging tech stack, a dazzling compensation package, and a genuinely interesting set of problems to solve. But I could just not commit to applying for this position.

The job description painted a picture of an organisation that cared about its engineering by listing the best practices that they follow and the languages that power their product and a culture which supports hack days and innovation from engineering up. They have a, granted outdated, engineering blog because presumably some of it's engineers are enthusiastic about sharing the interesting projects they are working on. They work exclusively in a domain that aligns directly with my interests and are looking for somebody enthusastic to do work similar to some of my own personal projects. The compensation package teased competitive pay and stock options; working on a diverse team of engineers for a popular consumer product. There are opportunities to travel around to work as part of the role, and perks of the office include catering and regular social events.

I was absolutely sold. Sure it'd maybe require a move, it might be tough starting over again, but I was unbelivably interested in the position.

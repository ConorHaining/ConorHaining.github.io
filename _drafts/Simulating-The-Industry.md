I was recently the lucky client to about 100 students at the University of Dundee. Students who are begining their final year of undergraduate study work intensley for three weeks on a project brief set by the client. For the students, the purpose is to be an accurate simulation of what it is like to work in the industry, the industry that these students are about to enter.

// What did I actually do? set project, attending meetings/demos, suggestions and advice, watch demos

This is the second year I've acted as a client for this module, but as my experience grows the further away I get from being a student, the more I believe it is harder to offer an accurate an authentic simulation for students, as well as how my own bias is skewing their persception. It's frankly a little overwhelming.

For the students, they are randomly assigned into one of ten groups. The size of the groups depends on the number of students in the year, this year there were ten people working together. The random assignment means that there is a good chance you will not have worked with most people so you're not as tuned to people's individual ways of working, on purpose similar to how you join a new organisation and then need to craft that groove yourself. The module aims to give students the expand and refine their knowledge on the software development lifecycle and I really want to help them achieve that.

# Challenges of a good simulation

// Working in teams of ten is too big

My first issue was the team sizes, [ten people is far too many to have working together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks's_law) on the same project and the same codebase. There were good reasons why the teams were so large, to not put a strain on the lecturers assesing the teams and also didn't take up additional time in my schedule as I met with each time to see their progress. I made some heavy indications early on that the teams would have to divide and organise themselves into a structure which would allow them to work more smoothly.

// Offered avenues for them to explore different roles in the industry
// Sign posting to other things

This was also an opportunity for them to learn more about specialisations in software and I was very keen to signpost the students towards those options. In some form or other there were people working on documentation, user experience, devops, quality assurance, as well as development work. It's obvious for me to say now but there are many avenues to explore in software that isn't strictly development, and when I was a student I was oblivious to them - as were some of my peers. Some teams also took on a person dedicated to product management, and scrum mastering. The outcome here was to show that if they don't nessicarily like coding but enjoy tech then they have options which they can explore. In past versions of this product, 

I was particularly keen for the students to learn more about infrastructure. Being able to write software is good, but if you're not able to get it out into the world then what's the point? We came up against this last year where many students used the server spaces provisioned by the university, and with around 80 students all fighting for the same resources, it became storm of conflict and blockers. I made some heavy suggestions that for their own sake, they will want to manage their own infrastructure. I personally believe that if you can't manage the infrastructure of your code, then you're doing a half job.

# The project brief

Last year's student were given a project to create a price comparison webiste based on average charges for certain procedures in US hospitals, based on Medicare payments — or something to that effect <small>medical billing is very hard and complex, perhaps that's [why it's a $9+ billion industry](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/medical-billing-outsourcing-market)</small> — but the project was pretty dull as far as university projects can go. We noticed that brief generated a lot of friction and misunderstanding, particularly around the data we supplied to the students and in turn this generated a lot of questions which we had to clarify.

The project I indended to set this year had to resolve those two pain points; firstly, the project had to be somewhat interesting, but simultaneously not too out there so it's attainable by all teams. Secondly, I had to reduce the friction for the teams to allow them to spend more time on their projects and less time clarifying questions and requirements. Not providing any data to the teams also means less responsibility on my side should there be problems with that, and I also believe sourcing, owning and maintaining that is valuable skils to learn.

I also wanted to leave the brief open in some respects because I wanted to let the students have some creative freedom that may disapear when the decisions on their software is no longer made by them. Setting an ideal brief is a pretty small target on a dartboard in my opinion, it has to be straightforward enough that all teams can sucessfully achieve a reasonable baseline but there needs to be the options there for extension so that they don't run out of work to do, while being entertaining and allowing for creative freedom.

I was inspired by the rise of the [online pub quiz](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/09/phones-away-please-the-rise-and-rise-of-the-online-pub-quiz) in April and May, as well as the sudden growth of many online communities as more people found themselves with a lot more time to spend on the internet.

# Week One

I really enjoying seeing how each group interprets the same brief, it speaks to the way that software development is more of a creative process than the mathematical nature of computers would have you believe. I was pretty humbled to see that all teams had taken on most of the baseline advice I'd set out at the start of the project; every team was using source control, they had picked a framework for rapid prototyping, and they were appropriately featuring branching. I had asked them to do these things because I knew myself that it's very easy to trip over yourself with these kind of projects, espcially in a scramble, so I was keen to give them the chance to really focus delivering their projects.

On the whole, teams generally went in one of two directions in an almost perfect split. Half of the teams focused more on project planning before commiting to any creation, these teams were keen to discuss their planning mechaisms - whether that was on JIRA, Trello, or a spreadsheet and understand what my priorities were as a client. These teams typically had spend time carfully considering their visual design and experience of the application. I think that served as a good base for the whole team to understand what is to be achieved but simultaneously having a "thing" to show and discuss with their client.

![Planrr](/images/planrr.png "Planrr")

Planrr was the result of my undergraduate dissertation while I was studying at the University of Dundee and graduated in May 2019. This was a huge and technically challenging project that I am nothing but proud of. However, due to some of the deliberate technical design decisions that I made as part of the research and to further my learning, I made heavy use of the AWS Free Tier which recently expired. As a result Planrr is too expensive to run.

I am still very interested in the future of mobility and transit, so I am very keen to hear from you if you're working in that area. You'll be able to contract me through anything that appears in the website footer.

# Planrr

Planrr was the result of my undergraduate dissertation while I was studying at the University of Dundee and graduated in May 2019. This was a huge and technically challenging project that I am nothing but proud of. However, due to some of the deliberate technical design decisions that I made as part of the research, it became unfeasibly expensive to run the application beyond the Amazon Web Service's free tier.

Thank you for coming to check it out.

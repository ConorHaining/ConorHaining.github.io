I am a Computing Science student at the University of Dundee. I have been interested and developing for
web systems since I was 15, initially starting in PHP and more recently Python. Iâ€™ve become very interested
in how real-time data feeds can be used to deliver valuable information. During group assignments, I was
often able to take the lead which aided in developing my project management and communication skills. I
am currently looking for an exciting and challenging internship position this upcoming summer to add to my
existing skills as well as learn something completely new and unique.

title: Viva Tech 2018 Notes
---
# Intro
Viva Tech, an annual technology & innovation conference in it's third year, is billed as _"the world’s rendezvous for startups and leaders to celebrate innovation"_. Held in Paris, this week it attracted 80000 attendees, 8000 European startups, dozens of large players in technology across Europe. It also featured talks from Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO; Ginni Rometty, IBM CEO; Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO; amongst many, many more.

I wanted to come to Viva since events I've attended in the past have had a very technical focus, I was interested to learn more about the themes of interest I have rather than specific technologies. Viva being on the fringe of tech & business allowed me to explore some theme in greater detail rather than focusing technology too in depth.

Viva Tech covered topics ranging from Artifical Intellegence, Blockchain, IoT, and Quantum Computing. It also looked many themes, including: Mobility, Smart Cities, Travel, African Tech scene, Startups, Future Tech, Digital Transformation, Tech for Good. Unfortunetly, I never got to see every talk I had planned to but below I am summerising what I picked up from a handful of the talks below.

# Day One Talks
I almost feel like I tried to do this conference on hard-mode, before attending I had packed my day with back-to-back talks. I should know better since it's inevitable that things will run behind — which of course they did. I attended as much as I could over the two days, and below I've written my notes up and take aways from some of my favourite talks. I've tried to keep them as breif as I can because this could stretch on and on.

##  Africa: The Story of Disruption & Emerging Startup Landscape

Typically when we think of the technology scene, and I am guilty of this as well, our minds jump to Silicon Valley. However there is a thriving startup and tech scene almost unnoticed in Africa. In this talk [Viola Llewellyn](https://twitter.com/VALlewellyn) discusses how more than anything, Africa needs to create opportunity for tech innovators rather than just an injection of captial. African innovators building apps and services is nothing new, but there needs to be a drive to push their products beyond MVPs and allow startups to reach the global market place.

## When Things Got All F*cked-Up
![Quang HOANG speaking on the Startup Stage @ VIVA Tech 2018](/images/IMG_20180524_103739.jpg)
On the startup stage, [Quang HOANG](https://twitter.com/qhoang09) was interviewed by Megan Murphy, former editor at Bloomberg to talk about dealing with failure. Quang created Plato, a service to track business expenses. They started as a mobile application but quickly found that since on average people file expenses infrequently that many wouldn't keep the application on their phone. They decided it would work better to integrate their service into already well established business tools, such as Slack & Salesforce.

Fortunetly, this occured at the height of chatbot craze and Plato did not struggle to acheive funding for their service. But the founders faced an issue of not being passionate about this integration. Personally I find the limited UI which can be acheived through chat/voice a challenge at the best of times. At this same thing, the constant changes and lack of passion cause their team of 3 developers to quit the company, the learned that they did not have sufficent engineering leadership in place to support their team.

One thing stood out for me at this talk, when asked by an audience member what do you need to do to be resilliant to failure, Quang replied that having humility was key.

## Behind the Scenes of the Mobility Revolution

I was really looking forward to this talk from [Rachel Picard](https://twitter.com/RPicard_SNCF) CEO at SNCF. Rachel talked about various ways SNCF (The French Rail operator) are innovating. She covered what they're doing in the short, medium and long term.

Over the course of May & June, SNCF are facing 24 days of strikes so in terms of short term innovation, they have created a chat bot which is capible of providing information to consumers during this prolonged period of disruption.

SNCF are also introducing new rolling stock to their TGV routes (High Speed), their medium term innovation revolves around these new trains which perform self dignostics on themselves and transmit information back to maintenance depots through the day. When the train returns to the depot, maintenance crews know where needs most attention rather than manually checking everything.

Their long term innovation is very out there. SNCF sent some engineers out to collaberate with teams currently working on Hyperloop. According to Rachel, SNCF are the only transport operator to be involved at the moment.

## Achieving Exponential Impact–AI in the Era of Responsible Tech
![Ginni Rometty @ VIVA Tech 2018](/images/IMG_20180524_121657.jpg)
In this talk, [Ginni Rometty](https://twitter.com/ginnirometty?lang=en) (CEO of IBM) talked about the need for responsible AI because the far reach and high impact that is will have across all industries. She also commented on the fact that we should have a better understanding of the AI we are using.

IBM believes, and I felt this from other talks, that the impact AI will have on the global workforce will be huge and the workforce of the future will require a new set of skills to be productive members of tomorrow's economy. They are calling these "New Collar" jobs, and interestingly IBM are setting up inititives to help do that training to provide people with the skills that they will need.

## The Leading Edge of Artificial Intelligence
Natasha Lomas of Techcrunch moderated this discussion with Luc Julia (Samsung) and Bruno Maisonnier (Anotherbrain) to talk about where AI is going in the future.

Quite quickly and strongly both pointed out (and was later echoed by many others including Eric Schmidt) that what we call Artifical Intelligence is no where near intelligent and both worry that it is a marketing term at the moment.

In general, when AI is discussed today, many mean Machine Learning which is taking data and being able to to say interesting things about that data when given new data. Future AI will likely involve specific chips which would minic the human brain.

## Smarter Together for Feel-Good Cities

This really interesting talk from Catherine Guillouard, CEO of RATP Group, talked about the need in the future for smarter cities. Population is set to increase around the world, and urban population are also expected to grow at a faster rate.

In order to do so, we must created an ecosystem to support operators (Transport, Utilties, Local Business) and allow them to work with each other to provide them with the data they need to operator together.

One other thing I found super interesting which Catherine mentioned very breifly was MaaS (Mobility as a Serivce), in the same sense as SaaS or IaaS. Linking back to the Rachel Picard (SNCF) talk from earlier, she mentioned that young people in France can pay a flat rate for access to TGV services. It's a very interesting idea which should be explored in my opinion.

## An Introduction to Quantum Computing
![Do Ewald @ VIVA Tech 2018](/images/IMG_20180524_171135.jpg)
Bo Ewald, President of D-Wave, offered an introdction to Quantum and how it can be used in industy. Without getting too technical, in the classical computers which we own today there are bits which can either be one or zero. This is the fundemental base unit which has been used since it's invention and everything we do today still relies on this very basic idea.

With Quantum Computers, this concept changes to Qbits where it can be in a state of both one and zero, or any combination between. This kind of power allows for computation of really interesting problems. In collaberation with other partners, D-Waze was able to perform optiminisation on traffic flow in China, best ad placement on mobile, prediction of health analysis among many other problems.

Pictured below is IBM's Quantum Computer. Interestingly, the processor for these computers isn't relatively large but since the computation needs to perform at near absolute zero, most of the equipment is to keep things cold.

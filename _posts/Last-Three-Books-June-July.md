title: Last Three Books (Number 1)
---

*Last Three Books will be this thing I want to do whenever I've read and made notes on three books I want to share.*

I'd originally wanted to make more time for reading and less time for the social internet at the start of the year. That didn't happen, in fact I had been "reading" Deep Work for about 6 months before I finished - ironic given that it's a book about productivity.

Since last December I've been increasingly mindful about the amount of time I spend in front of a screen and that's what's really driving this. For non fiction I'm taking a couple of notes and what follows is a combination of those notes plus any thoughts or takeaways I've had from what I've been reading.

# Deep Work by Cal Newport
In this book, Cal Newport discusses how bring more value from your time. Deep Work is the idea of purposefully dedicating your attention and energy on a singular large complex task. Tasks such as writing a book, building software, or studying. Tasks that demand a huge cognitive load on a persons part to successfully achieve the goal.

This is opposed to shallow work, low demand, quickly fulfilled tasks, that typically distract or disengage from your meaningful work. These are instant messages, emails, calls, and meetings. The general day-to-day of a typical business. Newport proposes rules and systems to eliminate as much shallow work from your life as possible, and don't misunderstand here either, elimination for the typical worker bee is impossible and ridiculous. 

Shallow work needs to occur for an organisation to function effectively, but the goal is to be mindful of the volume of shallow work that appears in our day-to-day. There are a number of suggestions in this book on how to tackle this problem while still being an effective person, and I'm just going to touch on a few that I found interesting and effective.

The idea of "Attention Residue" when you are switching tasks, the attention doesn't follow, going from deep working to shallow working, and straight back into deep working isn't a case of "this will just take a minute", there is a notable (and studied) deficit in a persons attention when this occurs.

By it's nature, long periods of time need to be dedicated to properly fulfil Deep Work, so an effective measure of maximizing that time if to batch schedule any shallow work where and when possible. For example, triaging your emails at the start of a day and **closing** the client until you're next period of shallow work. I'm *trying* to go through my emails in the morning, after lunch, and before I leave - I am saying this as somebody who doesn't receive a lot of emails - but I intend to stick to it. The rationale here is that, except in very rare circumstance, it's not vital to respond immediately to email. Newport cites a study in which sales employees had their access to email removed between certain hours (removing their ability to send/respond outside business hours) and a control group who were allowed to carry on with their normal habits. The study found little to no difference in customer satisfaction between these groups, indicating that waiting til the following business day to respond had no measurable effect and that it would be acceptable for these sales people to hold off on replying.

A grand gesture shift in environment can be gratefully beneficial to fulfilling deep work. A story I really enjoyed was learning that J.K. Rowling hired the entire top floor of Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel in order to finish the final Harry Potter book. Rowling cited explicitly that her home life was proving such a distraction that she was simply unable to write the book. I'm not in a position ~~yet~~ where I can hire the top floor of the Balmoral, but I have found a change in environment helpful to working on my personal projects. I've found a spot in Edinburgh where I work on my own things before I go to work in the morning here I can be isolated, and I've found myself being able to work more effectively in this location.

# Brotopia by Emily Chang

A brutal, honest, and disgusting examination of how the technology industry fails woman, primarily in Silicon Valley, but applicable internationally. Emily Chang, of Bloomberg Technology, spoke to hundreds of woman about their experience working in tech from engineers & executives, to investors and recruiters. Diversity is the elephant in the valley, and rightfully so, every organisation is failing. Chang provides an interesting history and series of events that lead to this mess.

While the industry was in its infancy (about the 80s), organisations were attempting to understand what makes a good engineer. One organisation in particular recruited two psychologists to evaluate what traits were common in their current engineers. Of the 1378 engineers evaluated, just 178 of which were woman. I am no statistician but that is not a great sample. This study concluded that engineers like to a) solve puzzles (something which, in my limited experience, is still commonplace in recruiting techniques) and b) they have a general dislike of people (fun fact: this is believed to be the origin of the 'loner-in-a-basement' stereotype).

As a result, when organisations began recruiting for these characteristics, it won't come as a surprise that primarily men were being hired and woman were being driven out of the industry. Therefore technology became less appealing to woman. Rinse and repeat.

In the early days of PayPal, one of the largest success stories of the web, the company purposefully hired 'people like us', the intention was to hire people who could easily align to the same goals as the rapidly growing organisation. An idea which sounds sensible of the face of it, however 'people like us' tended to mean 'friends' and typically your friends aren't that dissimilar to you.

In it's early days, Google founder Sergey Brin instructed their recruited that they could not hire another male engineer until they had hired a female one. This went as far as passing a candidates interview packet onto a completely new committee to review. On one occasion, Marrisa Mayer - who went on to be Yahoo CEO - interviewed an engineer who was being an ass and Brin refused to hire him when he continued to be be arrogant to other female interviewers. Google has since went on to totally fuck it by not promoting woman at the same rate as their male counterparts, accusations of executives coercing subordinates into sexual activities while paying those executives off (see: Andy Rubin), and accusations of internal sexism within the organisation with little recourse for those employees.

Within organisations, their perks reflected their attitude. Companies were quick to offer beer, pool and table tennis to it's staff but slower to offer quality childcare. When Google increased their parental leave for new mothers, they saw a 50% increase in retention amongst female employees.

When it comes to the other side of Silicon Valley, the investors, the story is much the same - primarily a boys club. And even female investors need to be more qualified than their male counterparts in order. A number of female founders felt their were being harassed by their male VCs but could not speak up due to fear of the potential financial penalty.

I'm only scratching the surface of what Emily Chang examines in her book, but the issue is real and deep rooted. Not only is it the moral thing to do, diverse teams outperform their non-diverse counterparts. For ever woman added to a companies executive board, they saw upwards of a 3% increase in profit.

Attempts to make a diverse workplace is not an attack on those who are already benefiting for it, me included, it is an opportunity to create better products, solve more problems, and bring light to issues we otherwise may have missed.

# Why Trams are Socialist

# Conclusion

The purpose of this kind of blog post is to really document how I am thinking and feeling about an issue at a particular point in time. I'm purposefully looking to read broadly on topics I'd likely not examine in any depth in my usual day. If there is something you think I'd like, you'll find my email below in the footer of this blog.

I have already got my next three books picked for over August (and maybe September) and hope to do the same again.

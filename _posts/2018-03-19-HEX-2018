This past weekend I was fortunate enough to find myself in Eindhoven to compete in the HEX Hackathon 2018. After a hop from Edinburgh across to Eindoven, I soon found myself in [Veemgebouw](http://www.vershalhetveem.nl/nl/home). Formally industrial storage, the building is now a mixed use building but on it's top two floors is a large open venue space.

This past weekend I was fortunate enough to find myself in Eindhoven to compete in the HEX Hackathon 2018. After a hop from Edinburgh across to Eindoven, I soon found myself in [Veemgebouw](http://www.vershalhetveem.nl/nl/home). Formally industrial storage, the building is now a mixed use building but on it's top two floors is a large open venue space.

These top floors formed the venue for HEX 2018, in what I mistook for basement space because of it's rugid, industral & urban feel coupled with some disorentation. Level 2 featured the main stage, regrestration, a relaxing space with couches and critically the source of food. Level 1 was the hacking venue with tables stretching the full length of the hall, RGB lighting along the pillars of the building and hackathon partners loning the middle of the hall.

Greeted by an energetic host, all participants were able to choose between two tracks of informaing and interesting workshops ahead of the hacking commencing at midnight. Armed with three friends, we were all prepared and ready to dive head first into the project.

# Our Project

We had been reviewing the tracks on offer at the event â€” there were 10 to choose from. We generated ideas in the Future Society, Future Mobility and HealthTech tracks but by the time hacking was to commence, we had settled on the [Future Society track](https://joinhex.com/future-society/).

The project is a social enterprise, 'Craft for a Cause',  and it's aim was to support those in rural and remote areas by giving them the platform to access the global marketplace and economy through our service. Communities would be able to offer bespoke and locally created crafts and 'Craft for a Cause' would handle the marketing, collection and distrubution of the products.

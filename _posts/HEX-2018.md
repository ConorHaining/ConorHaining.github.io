This past weekend I was fortunate enough to find myself in Eindhoven to compete in the HEX Hackathon 2018. The event set to run for 32 hours from 0000 Friday/Saturday to 0800 Sunday, my second hackathon and longest to date.

A hop from Edinburgh across to Eindoven, and I soon found myself in [Veemgebouw](http://www.vershalhetveem.nl/nl/home). Formally industrial storage, the building is now a mixed use building but on it's top two floors is a large open venue space.

These top floors formed the venue for HEX 20418, which had a urban & industrial vibe which was different from what I've seen or known from other hackathons.

Level 2 featured the main stage, regrestration, a relaxing space with couches and critically the source of food. Level 1 was the hacking venue with tables stretching the full length of the hall, RGB lighting along the pillars of the building and HEX partners lining down the middle of the hall.

Greeted by an energetic host, all participants were able to choose between two tracks of interesting workshops ahead of the hacking commencing at midnight.

# Our Project

We had been reviewing the tracks on offer prior to going to the event â€” there were 10 challenges to choose from. We generated ideas in the Future Society, Future Mobility and HealthTech tracks but by the time hacking was to commence, we had settled on the [Future Society track](https://joinhex.com/future-society/) sponsored by Bloomberg.

The project is a social enterprise, 'Craft for a Cause',  and the aim was to support people in rural and remote areas by giving them the platform to access the global marketplace and economy through our service. Communities and crafters would be able to offer bespoke and locally created crafts and 'Craft for a Cause' would handle the marketing, collection and distrubution of the products by providing the crafts to our patrons.

Furture plans included a Virtual Learning Environment to train our Crafters in order to allow them to expand their product range and allow them to increase their income and expansion on the marketing of the communities and our crafters within those communities.

I really enjoyed our techinical stack, having dominantly PHP experience I was really eager to use something else over the weekend:
- NodeJS backend
- EJS templating
- Materialize CSS Framework frontend
- Mongoose OEM
- Mongo DB
- Twilio API integration
- Stripe API integration

## What I've Learned & Challenges

I am relatively new to Node.JS having only being able to tinker it within the past few months on various things here and there. So I still found myself navigating it's nusances and quirks. I now feel considerably more comfortable using Express and NodeJS, and I'm planning on using it in future projects. However still feeling a little shakey, I wasn't able to blast through some Node functionality as fast as I might within Slim or Laravel.

I was responsible for implementing the [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/) into our product to allow for communication between our service and our crafters. The idea was that in remote areas, data connection may be sparse and/or expensive so communiaction by SMS was preferred. The challenge I faced here was being able to link up a response from a crafter to whatever order & product they were providing since the crafter would only be providing some notice of confirmaton such as 'ok' or 'yes'. The solution I found was to store all outgoing messages in a Model and query when a response was received based on which number it came from and preform any changes in there.

# Future plans

Having since gotten my first taste of a Hackathon last year, I was itching to attend more. I've even went as far as organising Dundee University's Annual [Quackathon](http://conorhaining.com/Dundees-Hackathon/) in 2017.

I've already planned to attend RGUHack this April & hopefully get another international hackathon before the year is out. Even some discussions of organising another hackathon, but that's a long way off.

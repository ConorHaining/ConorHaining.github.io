After four years in the School of Computing at the University of Dundee, I graduated in May earlier this year. I had always enjoyed software development and computing at large so it was very rare for me to be genuinely stressed about the grades I was receiving. I wasn't always hitting it out of the park, but that was fine, I was always heading for the classification I wanted which was the main thing really. I was mostly pretty relaxed about it all, that's not say to it wasn't without it's challenges.

But I had other ways to make me feel like I was competent at what I was saying and doing. I went across the country and Europe to hackathons, competing five times and (organising one at Dundee University)[]

title: Being a little fish
---
After four years in the School of Computing at the University of Dundee, I graduated in May earlier this year. I had always enjoyed software development and computing at large so it was very rare for me to be genuinely stressed about the grades I was receiving. I wasn't always hitting it out of the park, but that was fine, I was always heading for the classification I wanted which was the main thing really. I was mostly pretty relaxed about it all, that's not say to it wasn't without it's challenges.

I've never felt that grades were a good reflection of ability, and that I was lucky to be good at getting tested. But I had other ways to make me feel like I was competent at what I was saying and doing. I went across the country and Europe to hackathons, competing five times and [organising one at Dundee University](https://conorhaining.com/posts/Dundees-Hackathon/), a legacy that's went into my career as a corporate sponsor for student hackathons across Scotland. In my final year of study, I was a lab tutor to a total seven different modules and would have supported well over a hundred students in some form or another. I also ran a [Codeclub](https://codeclub.org/en/) at a local primary school for around 2 and half years, which I felt did wonders for my communication skills and requires a lot of patience. 

 I knew I enjoyed what I did a lot, I've always gotten a lot of satisfaction out of it - I think that's a relatable sentiment for many programmers. So why was it that when I first entered the industry for realsies that I hit with feeling like a serious fucking idiot a lot of the time?

 # A serious fucking idiot

To have such a juxtaposition of feelings was a real source of anxiety for me, anyone who has known me for a long time knows I'm computer daft and I always have been. I really wanted to understand why I felt like this, because I really hoped it wasn't the case.

I tried something pretty bold, I kept a list of the mistakes I've make since starting this job with a commitment to only do them once, understand why and never again. This isn't something I'd want to share in it's entirety but we'll get to the highlight reel a little later on. Out of this list, I noticed a handful of common themes that I was never taught or even hinted at during education. Retrospectively they're obvious now but a heads up would have been nice.

Firstly, absolutely every single thing I've ever done up until this point as been a greenfield project. I've never had to dive into an existing code and understand what a previous developer has written. All assignments are short lived, no more than 3 weeks in an extreme case, so if I had to understand why somebody did something it was always easy enough to ask. I had a bit of a gap since I wasn't really use to reading and deeply understanding some code. This problem was compounded by working with a language I was mostly unfamiliar with. I think it's generally accepted that reading and understanding other people's code is difficult, certainly a sentiment I can get on board with, and it seems to be only something that gets better with time.

We use C# for the vast majority of our backend systems, a language I had only _very_ briefly used in a university assignment a long time ago. And even then it was more a look at multi-threading than it was the features of C#.

Trying to understand the business process was also something else that took some time. Knowing that software development isn't just a case of beep boop and ship it, but understanding what our processes are is a challenge, and especially because these processes exist to minimise errors and disruptions. University assignments lets me put on many different hats. Particularly my honours project, I was all the hats; I was the product manager, I was the UX designer, the developer, the tester, I was devops, I was it all. It was a great opportunity for me to learn a little about a lot, but not really master anything. Now I was surrounded by people who were much better at wearing those hats than I was now learning how all the hats work with each other.
